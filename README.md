# Introduction
During my last year at BIU in the B.Sc degree we studied the ML course.

We learned about KNN, Perceptron, SVM, CNN, RNN, K-Means and more.

During the course we learned both the basics of each ML models and their implementation in Python.

Here is a repo containing four works I created during the course and their results, in an accessible and orderly form.
enjoy :)
